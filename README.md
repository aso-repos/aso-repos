I was bitten by the computer/programming bug at age 12 when my dad bought our first computer, a Commodore 64. I spent many hours experimenting with BASIC and created my first animation application.

How about "Unfortunately, despite my passion for coding, the early 1980s didn't offer many prospects in programming. Instead, I studied and pursued a career in desktop publishing and spent over two decades in the industry. However, in 2015, the decline of print media led to the closure of my employer

I could never stay far away from the IT side of things, though.  I constantly explored new technologies, built computers from spare parts in my free time, and delved "under the hood" of software applications.

I refocused on programming in 2014 when I got my certification in HTML5 and CSS3. Since then, I have focused on web development, mainly working on CMS systems like Joomla! and WordPress.

But the allure of programming remained steadfast, though. In 2023, I completed two Python Specialization courses through the University of Michigan and obtained certification in PySide6, enabling me to develop graphical interfaces for desktop applications. As a result, I created and compiled my first Windows text editor, which I am currently using to write this introduction.

Although I had a brief introduction to topics such as SQL databases, data structures, web data accessing & processing, and Python libraries like PIL and OpenCV, I realize that my coding journey has only just begun.

Currently, I'm enrolled in a Django Specialization Course at the University of Michigan. This course not only provides me with a fresh perspective on web development but also exposes me to popular languages like Javascript while refining my HTML/CSS and SQL skills.

By continuously creating new applications to apply my newly acquired knowledge, I also gain practical experience. I also remain focused on determining which programming language or technology to master next. Although I entered the field later in life, at over 50, my commitment to becoming the best developer possible remains unwavering. I firmly believe that the diverse knowledge gained from my years in various related fields will greatly contribute to achieving my goals.
